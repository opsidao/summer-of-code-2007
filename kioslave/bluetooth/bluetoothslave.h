 *  - bluetooth:/[Device]/             : lists the services available on the given device. Device must be a UBI.
 *  - bluetooth:/[Device]/service-name : must open a handler for the given service, how to do this is still undefined
 *
 * TODO: Some systems might have more than one bluetooth adapter, how do we handle that?
 * TODO: Depending on the previous, Device will include the path to the local device or not
 * TODO: Current implementation requires the URL to include the Bluetooth Device Address, and doesn't support aliases.
 * TODO: Define how to handle a given service
